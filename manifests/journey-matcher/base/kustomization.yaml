      # Take care with APC_WAIT_IN_SECONDS. If set too low, passenger counts
      # arriving late to the server will be matched to the next stop. If set too
      # high, the next stop will be reached before the passenger counts are
      # summed and sent onwards, which would make it ambiguous which stop the
      # passenger counts belong to.
      #
      # Also, APC_WAIT_IN_SECONDS delays sending the OccupancyStatus results
      # into trip planners downstream. Thus after
      #
      # The first priority is to keep the stop matching accurate. The second
      # priority is for the anonymized passenger counting results to reach trip
      # planning engines and passenger-facing UIs quickly.
      #
      # Consider the scenario where a bus departs a stop after serving
      # passengers but passes the very next stop without stopping, presumably
      # passing as fast as possible. A rough analysis of over 300_000 stop
      # events from Kuopio and Jyväskylä implies that the time difference
      # between such stop events is at most 22 seconds in 0.5 % of the cases,
      # i.e. in 99.5 % of the cases it takes longer than 22 seconds.
      #
      # That sounds unbelievably low and there might be error sources in the
      # data, e.g. network delays affecting vehicle timestamp in the GTFS
      # Realtime Vehicle Position feed that could bring some stops temporally
      # artificially close to each other. However, let's take the 22 seconds as
      # a dangerous upper bound for APC_WAIT_IN_SECONDS.
      #
      # The dangerous lower limit would be the upper percentiles of the delay
      # between APC devices generating and sending their results. The network
      # delays over the public internet are not in our control but in general
      # those can be expected to stay in the 100s of milliseconds, thus quite
      # negligible.
